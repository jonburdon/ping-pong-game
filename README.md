# Ping Pong Game - Test Driven Development Demonstration

### Red Green Refactor philosophy

This javascript game accepts a number input, or the word ping or the word pong.
If the number is with the range 0-10, the game returns the number bond to 10.
If the input is "Ping", the game returns "Pong" and vice versa.


Git commit has been used to demonstrate development of the product using Red Green Refactor approach.
Jasmine was loaded via a cdn. Each stage of the development was commited to git to demonstrate the following cycle for each piece of logic in the game code:
1. Write a test that will fail
2. Write only enough code to pass the test
3. Refactor the code to improve it

### Technologies used
- HTML
- javascript
- Jasmine
- Git


### Future plans
[ ] Add buttons and instructions to index.html so that the game can be played in the browser.
